ðŸ§  MyGO: Make Your Goals Obvious

MyGO is a deep learning model for prostate cancer MRI segmentation that avoids semantic confusion by selectively modeling key global features. It introduces a novel Pixel Fulcrum Module and integrates self-attention with Top-k selection to enhance feature interpretation while reducing computational redundancy. The architecture is built upon a U-KAN backbone and leverages KAN Layers for nonlinear semantic learning.

ðŸŽ¯ Highlights

Pixel Anchor Module: Learns sparse anchors to capture semantic context.

Top-k Attention: Selects the most relevant anchor features.

Focal Loss Integration: Addresses class imbalance in small lesion regions.

U-KAN Framework: Strong modeling for high-order nonlinear features.

SOTA Performance: Achieved 69.73% mIoU and 74.32% Dice on the PI-CAI dataset.
